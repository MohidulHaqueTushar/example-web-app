# Web Application
A simple Flask web application, containerized using Docker for easy deployment. This project demonstrates how to build, run, and deploy a Python Flask app both locally and using Docker.


## Using Docker
You can run the application directly from the docker hub by using the following command:
```
docker pull haque313/my-simple-web-app
```

## Build
you can also build the image again by using the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/MohidulHaqueTushar/example-web-app/blob/main/Dockerfile.txt) and [app.py](https://github.com/MohidulHaqueTushar/example-web-app/blob/main/app.py) from this github repository.
